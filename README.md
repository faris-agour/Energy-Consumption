# Energy Consumption Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes energy consumption data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and improve sustainability. The dataset includes information about energy consumption across different sectors, time periods, and geographic locations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Timestamp**: Date and time of energy consumption recording.
- **Energy Consumption (kWh)**: Amount of energy consumed.
- **Sector**: Sector consuming the energy (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial).
- **Region**: Geographic location of consumption.
- **Weather Data**: Optional features like temperature, humidity, etc.

## Objectives
1. Analyze trends in energy consumption over time.
2. Compare energy usage across different sectors.
3. Explore geographic variations in energy consumption.
4. Identify opportunities for energy efficiency improvements.
5. Visualize insights for effective communication.
