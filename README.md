# Energy Consumption Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes energy consumption data to identify trends, patterns, and key factors affecting energy usage across different building types. By exploring the impact of building characteristics, occupancy, and temperature, this analysis provides insights for optimizing energy efficiency and reducing costs.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following key features:

- **Building Type**: Type of building (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial).
- **Square Footage**: Total area of the building in square feet.
- **Number of Occupants**: Number of people present in the building.
- **Appliances Used**: Count of electrical appliances in use.
- **Average Temperature**: Average indoor or outdoor temperature (in Â°C).
- **Day of Week**: Day on which the energy consumption was recorded.
- **Energy Consumption (kWh)**: Total energy consumed by the building.

## Dashboard Insights
The project includes interactive dashboards to highlight key energy consumption patterns:
- **Energy Consumption by Building Type**: Comparing energy usage across residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.
- **Impact of Square Footage & Occupancy**: Understanding how building size and occupancy influence energy consumption.
- **Effect of Temperature on Energy Usage**: Exploring correlations between temperature and energy demand.
- **Daily Energy Consumption Trends**: Analyzing variations in energy usage across different days of the week.

## Objectives
1. Analyze trends in energy consumption across different building types.
2. Identify how square footage and occupancy levels impact energy usage.
